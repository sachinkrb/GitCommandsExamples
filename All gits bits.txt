THERE ARE THREE 3 MAIN LOGICAL AREAS OF REPOSITORY.
1.WORKING TREE
Our file system where working files and directories are.

2.STAGING AREA (INDEX)
Once we make changes to the files that we want to commit, it is ADD-ED in this area.

3.HISTORY (COMMITS)
This is where we make our commits with a message. The information is saved in .git file. If one has access to 
.git, he will have access to all the commits and its history.

git init  #initialize a new empty repo in a directory(working tree)

git config --global user.name "name"  #Give it the author name " Dave Davey"

git config --global user.email "email"  # Give it the author email "davedavey@email.com"
(--local option as well) # for particular repo 
 
git status  #see the state of files in working tree, staging area vs latest commit in git history 

git add #move file(s) to the staging area 

git log  #view the git history / git commit graph 

git diff  #diff of working tree and staging area 

git diff --cached  #diff of staging area and latest commit

git rm  #remove a file from the working tree and the staging area 

git checkout -- filename  #retrieve a file from the staging area into the working tree

git reset HEAD filename  #retrieve a file from the latest commit into the staging area 

git checkout (commit hash) filename  #retrieve a file from a previous commit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git log = git history 

git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph = commit history graph 

git branch (branch-name) = create a branch 

git checkout (branch-name) = checkout a branch/move head pointer 

git commit -a -m "commit message" = commit all modified and tracked files in on command 

(bypass separate 'git add' command) 

git diff master..SDN = diff between 2 branches 

git merge (branch-name) = merge branches (fast-forward and 3-way merges) 

git branch --merged = see branches merged into the current branch 

git branch -d (branch-name) = delete a branch, only if already merged 

git branch -D (branch-name) = delete a branch, including if not already merged (exercise caution here) 

git merge --abort = abort a merge during a merge conflict situation 

git checkout (commit-hash) = checkout a commit directly, not through a branch, results in a detached HEAD state 
git stash = create a stash point 

git stash list = list stash points 

git stash list -p = list stash points and show diffs per stash 

git stash apply = apply most recent stash 

git stash pop = apply most recent stash, and remove it from saved stashes 

git stash apply (stash reference) = apply a specific stash point 

git stash save "(description)" = create a stash point, be more descriptive
