THERE ARE THREE 3 MAIN LOGICAL AREAS OF REPOSITORY.
1.WORKING TREE
Our file system where working files and directories are.

2.STAGING AREA (INDEX)
Once we make changes to the files that we want to commit, it is ADD-ED in this area.

3.HISTORY (COMMITS)
This is where we make our commits with a message. The information is saved in .git file. If one has access to 
.git, he will have access to all the commits and its history.

git init  #initialize a new empty repo in a directory(working tree)

git config --global user.name "name"  #Give it the author name " Dave Davey"

git config --global user.email "email"  # Give it the author email "davedavey@email.com"
(--local option as well) # for particular repo 
 
git status  #see the state of files in working tree, staging area vs latest commit in git history 

git add #move file(s) to the staging area 

git log  #view the git history / git commit graph
